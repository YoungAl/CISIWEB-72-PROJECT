<h3>Safety</h3>
<p> 
    Safety is of utmost importance when it comes to cleaning. Cleaning products and equipment can pose significant health hazards if used improperly, and it is important to take precautions to avoid accidents or injury. In addition to the potential risks to our own health and safety, cleaning products can also have harmful effects on the environment if not disposed of properly. At SoCal General Cleaning Services, we take safety seriously and make every effort to ensure that our clients and our team are protected while cleaning. We use environmentally-friendly cleaning products whenever possible, and we take care to properly dispose of any hazardous materials. By prioritizing safety in all of our cleaning practices, we are able to provide our clients with a healthy and clean living or working environment, while minimizing any potential risks or harm.
